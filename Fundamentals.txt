1) Source code Vs Object code

- Source code is generally program written by user in particular programming language by following the language syntax.
- Example .java

- Object code is a output obtained, when source code is compiled by particular language compiler.
- Example .class

2) Compiler with flags

- Flags are used in compiler to enhance the performance of compiler to reduce code size and execution time.

3) Keywords, Variables

- Keywords are the reserved words in a programming language, which has specific defination and function. Keywords cannot be used by the users for the variables names.

- Variables are the used to store the data entered by user such as number,text. Once the variable is declared it can be used anywhere in the program until its scope.

4) Variable scope, lifetime, initial value, modifiers

- Scope of a variable refers to in which areas or sections of a program where the variable can be accessed.

- Lifetime of variable refers to how long the variable remains alive in the memory.

- Initial value is the value that contained in the variable at the time of declaration.
- Local variables does not have any default value, hence the user has to initilize at the time of variable declaration.
- Class level variables has a respective default values.

5) Programming Constructs (Selection construct and loop constructs)

- Selection constructs are generally refers as conditional statements such as IF statement.

- Loop constructs are used when we want to executes a number of statements particular time. (for, while, do while)

6) Declare Array, Store data in array and process elements

- An array is the collection of elements of similar data type by contagious memory allocation.
- Array is linear data structure, the size of the array need to defined at the time of array initialzation.
- The elements of an array accessed using the array index.

1) Linkedlist

- Linear data structure
- Dynamic allocation.
- Can access elements of linkedlist only by sequence.
- Linkedlist are used when we want to store some variable number of elements(not fixed size).
- Insert and delete operation performance are fast.
- update and retrieve operation performance are slow.
- Usage of meromry is high.
- Memory is assigned during run time.

2) Stack

- Linear data structure
- Static allocation
- Performs Last In First Out operation

3) Queue

- Linear data structure
- Static allocation
- Performs First In First Out operation

4) Binary tree

- NonLinear data structure
- The first node in the tree is a root node.
- Each node can have atmost two childrens left child and right child.
- Each node contains three components left subtree, right subtree and data element.
